# 📣 Social Media Campaign — Case Study
Brand Identity, Strategy, and Content Design for a Local Business

This project presents a complete social media strategy designed for Bar Giulianelli, a small local bar established in the 1990s in Villa San Giovanni in Tuscia.
The campaign focuses on strengthening the bar’s online presence, improving engagement, and refining its communication style to better connect with a younger audience.

##  Context & Initial Research

The bar has evolved over time from a morning-focused café to a youth-oriented cocktail bar.</br> The analysis began by examining:

- the bar’s current social profiles on Instagram and Facebook (page 4) 

- the local competitive landscape, consisting of four similar venues (page 3) 

- the target audience shift, highlighting the need to focus on users aged 15–35, who are more active on Instagram than Facebook (page 4) 

The research also included social listening: since the bar’s staff interacts daily with customers, their personal accounts and stories play a key role in spreading content organically (page 5)

## Campaign Objectives

Based on the analysis, the campaign sets several strategic goals:

- Enhance the bar’s brand personality and visual identity

- Improve engagement through interactive content (polls, questions, reposts)

- Support the bar’s core activities: events, cocktails, and community-building

- Standardize weekly content publication to maintain consistency (pages 6–11) 


The strategy aims to move from occasional posting to a structured editorial calendar.

## Strategy & Tone of Voice

A renewed tone of voice was defined—friendly, simple, personal—reflecting the atmosphere of a youth-oriented local bar (page 7) </br>
Strategic choices include:

- Reposting user-generated content, especially customers’ photos and videos

- Shifting staff and event tagging directly into images, increasing visibility (page 8) 

- Introducing recurring slogans and keywords to strengthen brand identity (e.g., “l’extra date che ci piace!”)

- Creating thematic posts about the venue’s history, iconic portraits, and staff members (page 10) 

These elements contribute to a cohesive, recognizable communication style.

##  Visual Identity & Content Design

The visual direction draws inspiration from:

the bar’s physical environment, especially its red tones and ’80s aesthetic (page 10) a mix of vibrant colors and contrasting accents, consistent with the nightlife atmosphere

Content categories include:

- event promotion

- behind-the-scenes and staff highlights

- personalized customer photos

- informative posts about the bar’s theme and icons (page 9–10) 

This adds both entertainment and educational value to the feed.

##  Editorial Calendar

To avoid inconsistent posting, a structured weekly plan was proposed (page 11):

Tuesday → promotional posts about cocktails/products, paired with local landmarks

Wednesday → history, curiosities, and storytelling-based posts

Thursday → event promotion for the weekend, with special attention to shareable graphics

This ensures frequency, variety, and coherence.

##  Monitoring & Community Interaction

The final stage focuses on increasing direct interaction (page 12):

- responding to comments

- reposting stories and customer content

- using Instagram questions, polls, and interactive stickers

- creating a WhatsApp broadcast channel for reminders and event updates

This improves community engagement and builds a two-way communication flow.
